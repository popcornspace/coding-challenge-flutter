## Challenge
As a pioneering MVNO startup utilizing satellite technology, you're committed to bringing unparalleled connectivity to every corner of the globe. To showcase your network's reach and capabilities, you decide to create an interactive Flutter app that automatically conducts a network speed test whenever the user opens the app. The app should log each test's results along with the user's geographical location, and then display the average download and upload speeds for the user's various locations.

## Requirements
Your application must include the following functionalities:
* Automatic Speed Test on Startup: Each time the app is opened, it should automatically begin a speed test to measure the user's current download and upload speeds.
* Location Tracking: Optionally, with the user's permission, track the location of each speed test to group results by location.
* Data Storage: Store the results of each speed test, including download speed, upload speed, and location.
* Average Speeds Display: Provide a user interface that displays the average download and upload speeds, organizing the data based on location. If location tracking is not enabled, display overall averages.
* Speed Test History: Allow users to view the history of their speed tests, showing individual test results with timestamps and locations (if available).

Features for an Enhanced User Experience:
* Speed Test Visualization: During each test, visually display the test's progress and results in real-time using graphs or progress bars.
* Map Visualization: If location tracking is enabled, use a map to visually represent the locations of the speed tests and possibly color-code areas based on speed ranges.

## Technical Notes
* You can simulate the speed test or use a public API if available, focusing on the frontend development aspects.
* For location tracking and mapping, use appropriate Flutter packages and ensure you handle permissions correctly for a smooth user experience.
* Since this is a frontend challenge, storing data locally on the device is sufficient.* 

## Grading
The grading of the app  will be based off of three criteria:
* **10%** - UI and UX
* **60%** - Overall Code Design and Structure
* **30%** - Data Management
